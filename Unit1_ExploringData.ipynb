We have a range of the feature \"weight\" between 51-109 kg and a range of the feature \"ap_hi\" between 100-170 mmHg. If we don't normalize the data, the model will give more importance to mmHg because the range is higher. To avoid false results, let's normalize the data between 0 and 1."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"HH2iVGrpc7Vf","cellView":"form"},"source":["#@markdown ## Min Max scaler\n","\n","# Normalize continuous features weight, ap_hi and ap_lo \n","cardio_scaled = cardio_categorize.copy()\n","scaler = MinMaxScaler()\n","columns_to_scale = ['weight', 'ap_hi', 'ap_lo']\n","cardio_scaled[columns_to_scale] = scaler.fit_transform(cardio_scaled[columns_to_scale])\n","display(cardio_scaled)\n","#cardio_scaled.to_csv (r'cardio_scaled.csv', index = False, header=True)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hypMIE4BlKXG"},"source":["# Data dimensionality\n","\n","The main problems of working with large amounts of data is the dimensionality of this.
