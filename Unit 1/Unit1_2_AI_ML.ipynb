The emergence of AI in clinical care has been a transformation of lives due to the wealth of benefits it offers to patients and hospital staff, for example:\n","\n","  <figure>\n","  <center>\n","<img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1rugm9YK7XxdjPd4mMVS3MpxvDEzSUH2w' width=400 height=400/>\n","</figure>\n","\n","\n","With the latest advances of **AI-Assisted Robotic Surgery**, Artificial Intelligence allows a robot to be a co-worker and not a surgical tool. This improves the quality of the intervention having more precision, collecting data and reducing time.\n","\n","\n","Another applications to pay attention to are **AI-Assisted Medical Diagnoses** and **Medical Risk Prediction**:\n","\n","- AI can assist doctors in *making better data-driven decisions*, for example, in case of diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases risk and not being totally sure of the final decision. Using historical data from other patients, always keeping privacy, the AI can predict it taking into account risk factors. The European Journal of Preventive Cardiology published an article \"Data-driven healthcare: From patterns to actions\" where they exposed some interesting examples of using available data and its applications <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267734327_Data-driven_healthcare_From_patterns_to_actions\">[1]</a>.\n","\n","- Early diagnoses can *reduce mortality*. AI can quickly provide a prediction of the type of disease and its treatment. In the article published by the Journal of Geriatric Cardiology \"The primary use of artificial intelligence in cardiovascular diseases\" enhances the importance of detecting early warning of symptoms to fight against the disease using AI <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6748906/\">[2]</a>.\n","\n","- *Reduce cost and time*. Monitoring patients and using AI to alert doctors reducing the focus on the healthier patients means that doctors can focus on the more alert patients.\n","\n","\n","One more applications to highlight is **Medical Image Analysis**. Using AI in imaging diagnosis, abnormalities can be more easily detected automatically. It helps early detection and reduces mortality. Besides, automated workflows improve the efficiency and reduce error of imaging diagnosis. For example in breast cancer detection:\n","\n","\n","  <figure>\n","  <center>\n","<img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?id=189Z5aUnjqaCoGw9CJT1RAN22QUG66kyZ' width=400 height=400/>\n","</figure>\n","\n","\n","In addition, AI can contribute to the **discovery of new drugs**. Regarding cancer and according to National Cancer Institute of EEUU \"*AI is being used to detect and interpret features of target molecules (e.g., proteins or nucleic acids that are important in cancer growth), make predictions for new drugs to target those molecules, and help evaluate the effectiveness of those drugs. Research is also being done to identify novel approaches for creating new drugs more effectively*\"<a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/budget/plan/artificial-intelligence\">[3]</a>.\n","\n","\n","This means an acceleration in the process of discovering new cures for this disease and reducing mortality.\n"]}]}
