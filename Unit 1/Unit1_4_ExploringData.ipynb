This is a preventive measure, but it can also help us with  referral decisions and thereby improve the triaging of patients. I am wondering if we can really trust this system.\n","\n","**Clinician:** Certainly, if we could predict cardiovascular diseases with some computer system, this might help us to prevent cardiovascular diseases in some patients, and it might reduce the number of patients who require intense treatments or supervision in the long term.\n","\n","**Data scientist:** What we can do is examine parts of the computer software and test them one by one.

It is supposed to read in the clinical information of a patient\n","2.   As a result, it should give us one or more numbers that we can interpret either as a risk, or as an indicator which test to take, or even as an indicator that a treatment is necessary.\n","\n","So we are looking for a computer calculation that receives input and produces output. This is what we call an algorithm, and the algorithm for us will be one that does not directly produce the output, but that produces a model -- that's what machine learning is about. Later, we can use the model on the input data. \n","\n","---\n","**Data scientist:** How does the machine learning algorithm know what the model should look like?\n","\n","---\n","**Data scientist:** It will learn this from examples. Right know, I will not explain to you how exactly machine learning generates a model from example data -- just wait one week, and you'll learn everything about it. But it is important to know that we need those examples.\n","\n","So. To build a model capable of helping in cardiovascular diseases prevention, first, we need to collect and store data of previous patients that the system can learn from. The system should learn to predict if someone is likely to develop a disease, so we need to know this already! This will be our dataset: many patients, with as much information we can get about them from the clinical systems, and most importantly: a label attached to each patient if he or she diseased, or if not.\n","\n","After that, in order to use the data efficiently, we need to analyze and prepare the data. I will show you how I do this in a minute. \n","\n","Then, it is time to run the machine learning to create the model (we say: we train the model). With the model, we need to assess the performance of the model, that is, how reliably it will predict the patient risk to disease.
