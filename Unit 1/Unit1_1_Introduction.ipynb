Every hospital has been encouraged to put in place initiatives:\n","\n","-  to improve prevention and local population management \n","\n","- to help keep population healthy and \n","\n","- lessen the need for acute care, in order to reduce the strain on staff and beds available. \n","\n","AI can help enable earlier prevention, in particular the use of an automated echocardiogram service to support physicians, run screening test to detect cardiovascular disease, increasing accuracy, reducing variability and increasing confidence for less expert staff.\n","\n","A group of hospital cardiologists are working together to define a screening methodology for GPs:\n","-  to identify early onset of cardiovascular disease in the community, \n","- increase prevention and optimise  referral and \n","- triage onto the appropriate hospital cardiology service. \n","\n","The aim is to:\n","-  focus healthcare provision on patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease, \n","- improve the use of limited hospital resources, and - optimise scheduling and waiting times for patients. \n","\n","This is a GP service with the hospital supervision. \n","\n","The GP will use an AI software solution for risk prediction that triangulates the patient medical history together with all investigation results and any additional information reported (e.g. personal information, blood pressure, smoking, physical activity and any other relevant information for cardiovascular disease). This will help to identify patients that need to be referred to the hospital cardiology service for further examination. However, there have been some concerns that the AI software will effectively be screening asymptomatic individuals. With a tool that is not 100% specific or sensitive there’s a risk of false positives and false negatives. \n","\n","Patient, 45 male, arrives at GP following an occurrence of sudden sharp pain in the chest when exercising, the pain quickly receded when they stopped and rested. After some routine checks, the GP refers the patient to the Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic for further investigation.\n","\n","\n","<figure>\n","<center>\n","<img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1QjPGBPjYhPcfOgFnfERLfJfUBboq3fKM' width=800 height=400/>\n","</figure>\n","\n","\n","After a week waiting, the patient attends their appointment at the Rapid Access Chest Pain clinic. The consultant sees the patient reviews their ECG, blood pressure and family history and they are referred to have a stress echo which has a 2 month wait. The patient is extremely dissatisfied by the duration of the waiting list and is very anxious.\n","\n","<figure>\n","<center>\n","<img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1iJ6rMjcaL6UDFiosKO01dcNHMY0cCzKI' width=800 height=400/>\n","</figure>\n","\n","However, the consultant explains the stress echo is precautionary their clinical indicators, lifestyle and age all point to a low risk of cardiovascular disease risk. Two months after their appointment at the Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic the patient attends the Cardiac Physiology Clinical Unit for a stress echo, the clinic is running late and the patient is anxious. After having the stress echo the patient is informed they will receive the results in 24-48 hours. \n","\n","They are contacted the next day and informed there have been errors in the equipment and the diagnostic quality is not sufficient. The patient is booked in for another stress echo in a month’s time. The patient contacts the hospital to complain, they remain stressed and anxious.\n","\n","\n","<figure>\n","<center>\n","<img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?id=14WSASIcyebSK0YMu2X8pSlydy4miAKL7' width=800 height=400/>\n","</figure>\n","\n","\n","\n","**Cardiology expert:** Hello, I am a cardiology consultant and lead the Cardiac Physiology Clinical Unit of a leading teaching hospital in Europe. The unit is very busy providing a wide range of patient procedures including \n","- echocardiography,\n","- electrocardiography, \n","- ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and \n","- nuclear cardiology imaging. \n","\n","There are a number of challenges facing the clinic. One of the most heavily used areas is echocardiology and so any improvements here will have significant impact for patients and the hospital. This area has long waiting times and delays to receiving prognosis after a scan. Patients are increasingly dissatisfied and staff are feeling increasing pressured and stressed. The service is seeing a slight increase in misdiagnosis and non-diagnostic quality images which is further worsening the situation. In addition, we’re seeing a trend of increasing age of the demographic of the community giving a slowly increasing demand for echocardiology services. \n","\n","I would like to introduce some new tools and technologies as a way of improving the unit and the patient care. I have read some journal articles showing Artificial Intelligence in the domain of imaging has demonstrated promising progress recently and could help address some of the unmet need in the department. Our overall aim is to identify new tools that will improve patient and staff experience, as well as increase efficiency and reduce waiting time.\n","\n","However, AI is still a very new technology in healthcare and I am unfamiliar with some of the basics. I feel there is cultural resistance from my colleagues who are highly suspicious of AI despite having little exposure or experience.\n","Looking at some of the recent patient feedback, resource constraints and waiting times I organize a meeting with my colleagues to explore alternative options to improve the clinic.\n","\n","\n","**Cardiology expert:** A pleasure to meet with you, I would like us to discuss the different technological solutions that we could implement in the hospital to improve the quality of the patient’s experience, lately we have received some complaints about waiting times and diagnostic failures. \n","\n","---\n","**Data scientist:** This is certainly a problem. Have you heard about Artificial Intelligence? AI would give us a lot of advantages by reducing time and improving our workflow. Can I introduce the technology?\n","\n","---\n","**Clinician:** Glad to discuss the best solution. Please introduce the Artificial Intelligence because I don't know it.\n","\n","---\n","**Data scientist:** Perfect, I will start with the more general concepts.\n","\n","\n","\n"]}]}
