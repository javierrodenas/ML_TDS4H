We haven't talked about \"modeling\" yet, so just to know for now: some algorithms for machine learning don't work well with outliers in data. \n","\n","Outliers, in a general sense, are examples that are very infrequent. Let's be concrete. You don't see typical cardiovascular diseases in children (excluding congenital heart failure here). This means, you will not expect or need your model to be working very well in children. If this is so, then if you happen to have a few examples of children in your dataset, you can safely exclude them. \n","\n","The same might go for extremely tall patients. But suppose one such group -- say, the tall ones -- are of interest, but you still have only very little numbers of examples, then they are outliers you don't wish to exclude. This means: be careful, and don't simply exclude \"rare\" cases automatically. You don't want to use the caterpillar in an archeological excavation site.\n","\n","So let's see the range of body heights and body weights we have. \n","\n","For this purpose, so-called Box Plots are a common analysis tool.

This means we only look at the data of those above the lower percentile, and below the upper.
